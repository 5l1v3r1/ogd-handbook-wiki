As soon as one starts [making an inventory](/identify/inventory) of datasets within an organization, a picture of the potential restrictions (technical, legal, costs) may start to emerge. It is worthwhile to have rules by which to map good candidates for OGD publication - especially if they have an active interest group of users, and after positive evaluation of *Cost Basis* and the *Ease of Release*.

The report on [Boundaries between OGD and custom individual services](/library/m5-abgrenzung-leistungen) (Adelheid BÃ¼rgi-Schmelz, 2014) defines in more detail the concept of OGD, explains economic fundamentals of the production and use of open data in government, and provides a decision tree for use in evaluating publication criteria.

In the [Worksheet for government authorities](/library/m7-recht-arbeitshilfe) (Anne Wiedmer, 2015) you will find a summary of the most important criteria, such as:

1. Is there a legal basis for the publication of the data set?
1. Can people be identified from attributes in the data, or do any records contain personal information?
1. Are these sensitive personal data?
1. Is there a legal precedent for the publication of such personal data?
1. Does a formal enactment exist for the publication of sensitive personal data?
1. Is any of the data to be published under copyright?
1. Were the copyrights of third parties or employees of the Federal Administration assigned to the federal government, with privacy rights waived?
1. May the records be published and made available for free?
1. May the records be used both non-commercially and commercially?
