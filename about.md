The structure of the OGD Handbook will be based around visual and contextual representations of the process of data publishing, providing an up-to-date reference for actual and potential data owners. Relevant documentation created as part of the OGD Switzerland project, as well as references from OGD projects around the world to be discoverable within.

We have already interviewed a number of organisations involved in the use and publication of OGD about their organisational readiness from the standpoint of knowledge sharing. The OGD Handbook team continues to gather feedback with a focus on evaluating the structure, quality and usability of learning materials. Such activities help us to be aware of best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing between stakeholders. See Goals and Needs to find out how to get involved.
