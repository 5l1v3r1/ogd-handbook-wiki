This page explains the basics of data portals, and discusses how open data can be shared using them around the world.

### How data is cataloged and provided through portals

A data portal is a database of links to resources, not unlike a document management system. Information is often collected there by the data owners - though not always, see for example, the crowdsourced portal [Datahub.io](http://datahub.io)

Such portals are designed to put together datasets from across many sources in one place, presenting information about them consistently, and including features like search, tagging and preview that assist end users in discovering the datasets they need. They also play an important role in connecting the data publisher and end user, for instance allowing people to more easily keep track of updates and changes to datasets they are using.

Most data portals combine datasets which are directly distributed on site, and remote datasets which are linked from the portal. Sometimes larger sized files and special requirements like geodata services are hosted externally, but in the the best case the user does not have to be aware of such details and just use the data.
