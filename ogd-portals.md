### How data is cataloged and provided through portals

A data portal is a database of links to resources, not unlike a document management system. Information is often collected there by the data owners - though not always, see for example, the crowdsourced portal [Datahub.io](http://datahub.io)

### Overview of steps involved in managing datasets

Data portals are designed to put together datasets from across many sources in one place, presenting information about them consistently, and including features that assist end users in discovering the datasets they need. They also play an important role in connecting the data publisher and end user, for instance allowing people to more easily keep track of updates and changes to datasets they are using.

Important steps in the process of uploading and managing a dataset include:

- ensuring the latest versions of content is available
- appropriate taxonometry and categorisation
- correct and complete labels and tagging (see [applying metadata](metadata))
- validating license details and contact information
- testing the ability to preview the data (if possible)

### Where is data stored

Most data portals combine datasets which are directly distributed on site, and remote datasets which are linked from the portal. Sometimes larger sized files and special requirements like geodata services are hosted externally, but in the the best case the user does not have to be aware of such details and just use the data.

### Harvesting updates with agents and scripts

For larger organisations with their own infrastructure, it becomes inconvenient and costly to upload datasets one at a time, so software programs called harvesters are used to collect details on each dataset and publish a selection of metadata to the data portal. These programs can also be run automatically to ensure that updates are propagated.

### Federation between portals

As open data portals proliferate, by some counts there are already thousands in the world, the question arises of what happens when datasets are published in multiple locations. Reaching a larger audience does not have to come with a high cost of repeated efforts to publish data: federation between portals is a kind of software contract that allows content to be shared between them: in this case, listings of open government datasets.
