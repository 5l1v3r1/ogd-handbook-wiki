A *data portal* is an online collection of links to resources. They are designed to put together datasets from across many sources in one place, presenting information about them consistently, and including features that assist end users in *discovering* the datasets they need. They also play an important role in connecting the data publisher and end user, for instance allowing people to more easily keep track of *updates and changes* to datasets they are using.

An *open data portal* is one that has a focus on providing datasets which are licensed under open conditions. See [criteria for OGD](/identify/criteria) for more background. Open data portals provide access to data mainly from government offices ([opendata.swiss](/publish/opendata-swiss)), science and academia ([openresearchdata.ch](http://openresearchdata.ch)), maps and Geographic Information Systems ([geo.admin.ch](http://geo.admin.ch)), and so on. The [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/#for-government) has more background on how open data portals work and their benefits to the user community.

For more information and to learn how data is published on open data portals, see the [Publish topics](/category/publish/) in this Handbook.

### Links to Open Government Data portals

**[opendata.swiss](http://opendata.swiss)** is the official Open Government Data portal of the Swiss Confederation.

Several Swiss Cantons and Communes have already started federating their collections with **opendata.swiss**, some also run their own data portals:

- [Canton of Zürich](http://opendata.zh.ch/) (opendata.zh.ch)
- [City of Zürich](http://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) (data.stadt-zuerich.ch)
- [Canton of Geneva](http://ge.ch/sitg/donnees) (ge.ch)

**Worldwide - directories**

- [Dataportals.org](http://dataportals.org/) is a comprehensive directory of data portals.
- [OpenDataSoft](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/) maintains a list of open data portals and sites around the world.
- [Datahub.io](http://datahub.io) is a crowdsourced data portal run by Open Knowledge.
