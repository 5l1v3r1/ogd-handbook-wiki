> This is an early draft topic in the [Swiss Open Government Data Handbook](chapters) and it needs more input. Please consider taking some time to [contribute](contribute) your expertise on this subject.

In pilot since 2013 and widely launched in 2016, the [Swiss OGD Portal](http://opendata.admin.ch) was developed with [CKAN](http://ckan.org), an open source platform for curating data catalogues developed with the popular Python programming language.

This page explains the basics of OGD portals and has usage notes, especially for government users who would like to know how to publish data from their organisation on a Federal level. See [OGD portals in Switzerland](ch-ogd) for links to projects on other levels of government.

Proposed sub-topics:

- How data is catalogued and provided through portals
- Adding new datasets to CKAN portal
- Harvesting updates with agents and scripts
- Federation between portals, architectural overview
