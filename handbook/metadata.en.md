Summary: Once you have selected your publication option, you need to upload the metadata to opendata.swiss.
---

This involves three steps:

1. Organizational and technical preparations by you as data supplier
2. Uploading to the opendata.swiss catalogue
3. Updated catalogue online at opendata.swiss.

The [user handbook](/en/library/anleitung-datenpublisher) contains detailed information on the opendata.swiss system.

## Preparations

Assign roles:

- Define the data owner: who in your organization is responsible for the data and for publishing them?  
- Define the data supplier: who has technical responsibility? (tasks may include metadata entry, testing, updates)
- Define who assesses the quality of the descriptions and the metadata and who can answer technical/content questions on the data fonds.
- Define the single point of contact (SPOC) for the portal operator.

Prepare the data and metadata:

- Verify the reference to the [legal framework for publication](/en/prepare/frameworks).
- Check that the [correct terms of use](/en/prepare/terms) have been chosen.
- Check the format in which the datasets are to be published.

> ### Recommended data formats

> Essentially, you can make your data available on opendata.swiss in any data format you choose. However, the Federal Archives recommend using one of the formats listed in [Recommendations for OGD Formats](/en/library/empfehlungen-formate).

- If necessary, carry out a quality check of the data

## Importing the metadata

Before you can import your metadata to opendata.swiss, the Federal Archives must enter your organization in the system. If your organization has not previously published data on the portal, please register by [contacting us](mailto:opendata@bar.admin.ch). You should then do the following:

- Familiarize yourself with the user interface and the DCAT-AP fields. Detailed information on the system can be found in the [opendata.swiss user handbook](/en/library/anleitung-datenpublisher).
- Enter the metadata, completing the fields defined in the [DCAT-AP standard](/en/library/ch-dcat-ap) (this will depend on the publication option chosen).
- Send us an image and a description of your organization, if possible in four languages (DE, FR, IT, EN). These will be published on your organizationâ€™s page ([for example here](https://opendata.swiss/en/organization/schweizerisches-bundesarchiv-bar)).

## Data online

The Federal Archives and the data supplier together ensure that all the data, metadata and descriptions are displayed correctly in the test environment.

Once you have given your consent, the Federal Archives will make the data available online.
