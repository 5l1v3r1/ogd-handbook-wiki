Methods of developing and maintaining metadata are used for validating quality and ensuring applicability of the datasets at large, and are a critical support vehicle for improving the potential for appropriate usage of open data.

When we say ‹data›, we mean ‹datasets› and ‹resources›. By **metadata**, we mean both *structural metadata*, design and specification of data structures; and *descriptive metadata*, which describes individual instances of content (see [Metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) - Wikipedia).

## Steps in managing datasets

Important steps in the process of uploading and managing a dataset include:

- ensuring the latest *versions* of content is available
- appropriate *taxonometry* and *categorisation*
- correct and complete *labels and tagging* (see [applying metadata](/publish/metadata))
- validating *license* details and *contact* information
- testing *links* to download/preview the data and related resources

Each of these steps are grounded in creating high quality metadata.

## Metadata harvesting

For larger organizations with their own infrastructure, it often becomes inconvenient and costly to upload datasets one at a time, so software programs called **harvesters** are used to collect details on each dataset and publish a selection of metadata to the data portal. These programs can also be run automatically to ensure that updates are propagated.

## Publishing metadata on opendata.swiss

You need to publish standardised information about your data, so-called metadata.  For publishers, the national Open Government Data portal **opendata.swiss** offers different ways to add their data to the metadata catalogue. The Open Government Data Switzerland project has developed a joint solution (see [M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards](/category/library)). The portal opendata.swiss implements these standards, and provides further documentation on the DCAT-AP standard: visit [Publishing on opendata.swiss](/publish/opendata-swiss) for background.
