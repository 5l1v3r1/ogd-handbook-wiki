Methods of developing and maintaining metadata are used for validating quality and ensuring applicability of the datasets at large, and are a critical support vehicle for improving the potential for appropriate usage of open data.

For larger organizations with their own infrastructure, it often becomes inconvenient and costly to upload datasets one at a time, so software programs called **harvesters** are used to collect details on each dataset and publish a selection of metadata to the data portal. These programs can also be run automatically to ensure that updates are propagated.

## Publishing metadata on opendata.swiss

You need to publish standardised information about your data, so-called metadata.  For publishers, the national Open Government Data portal **opendata.swiss** offers different ways to add their data to the metadata catalogue. The Open Government Data Switzerland project has developed a joint solution (see *Selection and definition of the OGD standards* [in the library](/category/library)).

The portal opendata.swiss implements these standards, and provides further documentation on the DCAT-AP standard: visit [Publishing on opendata.swiss](/publish/opendata-swiss) for background.
