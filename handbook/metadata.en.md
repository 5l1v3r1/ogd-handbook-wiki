Methods of developing and maintaining metadata are used for validating quality and ensuring applicability of the datasets at large, and are a critical support vehicle for improving the potential for appropriate usage of open data.

When we say ‹data›, we mean ‹datasets› and ‹resources›. By **metadata**, we mean both *structural metadata*, design and specification of data structures; and *descriptive metadata*, which describes individual instances of content (see [Metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) - Wikipedia).

## Publishing metadata on opendata.swiss

You need to publish standardised information about your data, so-called metadata.  For publishers, opendata.swiss [offers different ways](/handbook/opendata-swiss) to add their data to the metadata catalogue. The ‹Open Government Data› project organisation have worked out a joint solution (see [M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards](/category/library)). The portal opendata.swiss implements these standards, and provides further documentation in the [DCAT-AP Switzerland](http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) manual.

### Readiness test

1. Get the [example XML file](https://github.com/ogdch/dcat-ap-docs/blob/master/ogdch_dcatap_import.rdf).
1. Fill the XML file for your metadata following the [documentation](http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dcat-ap-format.htm[]()).
1. Send your XML-file for validation to the [portal team](mailto:opendata@bar.admin.ch)
1. Wait for the portal team to get back to you with feedback.
