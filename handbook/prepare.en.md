A number of open data formats are available that are accessible on all platforms, without the restrictions of proprietary standards. Factors when considering data formats include the *structure* and *portability* of the container for your data. A well structured spreadsheet, for instance, is easy to read and managed. It has appropriate and helpful metadata, and when the data is expanded or updated, it is clear where new information needs to go. Portable data formats are non-proprietary, so the files can be opened with generally available or free software on any computer platform, and part of a widely accepted *standard*.

> Making sure that you are providing machine-readable formats allows for greatest re-use. To illustrate this, consider statistics published as PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, often used for high quality printing. While these statistics can be read by humans, they are very hard for a computer to use. This greatly limits the ability for others to re-use that data.

## Guidelines for data publishers

[SIARD eCH-0165](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en) is a set of recommendations for the Archiving of Databases developed by the Swiss association eCH.

There are many tools that are used in migrating (or converting) from one format to another. One needs to consider both how well the metadata and the actual data is preserved when it is moved from one format or environment to another, potentially reducing longer term costs of maintenance and reuse. Standards like the [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) (OAI-PMH) and those of [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards) with newer initiatives like [Data Pipies](http://datapipes.okfnlabs.org/) and [Bubbles](http://bubbles.databrewery.org/), are technical and logistical initiatives for making migrations happen more efficiently.
