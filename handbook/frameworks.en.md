What are the main legal frameworks that data publishers in Switzerland need to be aware of? What aspects and decision points do we need to be aware of when supporting Open Government Data? These resources will help you make sense and tackle grey area in regards to your organization's needs.

### Guidance for data publishers

[Concept: legal framework for the publication of data as Open Government Data](/en/library/konzept-rechtliche-rahmen) is a document produced within the Open Government Data Switzerland project, with legal recommendations for data publishers. There you can find a complete description of some of the following criteria:

1. Is there a legal basis for the publication of the data set?
1. Can people be identified from attributes in the data, or do any records contain personal information?
1. Are these sensitive personal data?
1. Is there a legal precedent for the publication of such personal data?
1. Does a formal enactment exist for the publication of sensitive personal data?
1. Is any of the data to be published under copyright?
1. Were the copyrights of third parties or employees of the Federal Administration assigned to the federal government, with privacy rights waived?
1. May the records be published and made available for free?
1. May the records be used both non-commercially and commercially?

The [Worksheet for government authorities](/en/library/arbeitshilfe-publikation) is intended to serve as an aid agencies for publication of records, showing test steps to be carried out by the authorities before a dataset under OGD is published. It contains a schema based on which we developed this flowchart:
