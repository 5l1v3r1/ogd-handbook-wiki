## Global indicators

Dataset usage is even an important measure on an international level, with the [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org) initiative providing a good high level overview of OGD availability around the world.

The [Open Data Barometer](http://www.opendatabarometer.org/)

## Metrics use

Active **use of metrics** can be used to judge the relative interest in different datasets, or evaluate approaches taken in disseminating the content. Metrics data (web, server, repos, social) should back any major strategic decisions in the evolution of the data.

Open source software that can be used to collect and re-publish metrics include [Piwik](http://www.piwik.org/), [graylog2](http://www.graylog2.org/), and [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/en/). Metrics data can also be embedded in the form of widgets into websites, and the metrics data in itself could be opened for public reuse.
