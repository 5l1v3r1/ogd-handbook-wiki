Summary: Metrics and indicators of use in comparing and optimizing interest and uptake of OGD.
Lang: en

A combination of high-level *indicators*, and low-level *metrics* can ensure that OGD projects are both appropriately scoped and planned, and as tools for monitoring and improving data offerings are accessed and interacted with. At their best, they are an instrument for closing the loop to improve collaboration between publisher and data user.

## Indicators

There is growing scientific interest in monitoring the development of data in an information society.

Dataset usage is even an important measure on an international level, with the [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org) initiative providing a good high level overview of OGD availability around the world. The [Open Data Barometer](http://www.opendatabarometer.org/) is a global expert study which dives into even more depth on the how and why's of data openness in different countries.

In Switzerland, studies such as [Ein Impact Monitoring Framework für Open Government Data am Beispiel von »OGD Schweiz«](http://digisus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OGD-CH-IMF-DACHLI-Bericht-V04-DOWNLOAD-VERSION.pdf) (Dapp/Stürmer 2013) and [Studie zu Open Government Data in der Schweiz](http://www.wirtschaft.bfh.ch/de/forschung/aktuell/newsdetails/article/studie-zu-open-government-data-in-der-schweiz/1100.html) (BFH 2012) provide indicators of economic and sociometric analysis.

## Metrics

Active use of metrics can be used to judge the relative interest in different datasets, or evaluate approaches taken in disseminating the content. Metrics data (web, server, repos, social) can be used to back up strategic decisions in the evolution of the data.

Open source software that can be used to collect and re-publish metrics include [Piwik](http://www.piwik.org/), which is the tool used on **opendata.swiss**. Metrics data can also be embedded in the form of widgets into websites, and the metrics data in itself could be opened for public reuse.
