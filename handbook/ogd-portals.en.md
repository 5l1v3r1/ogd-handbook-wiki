Summary: An overview of how data portals work, how to publish data to them, and where to find them.
Lang: en
Draft: yes


A *data portal* is an online collection of links to resources - scroll down in this topic for some examples. This has similarities to a Document Management System, which often provides the ability to directly download and/or query structured data. These datasets are often collected with involvement of the maintainers of the data portal - though not always, as in the case of crowd-sourced portals like [Datahub.io](http://datahub.io), or linked data portals like [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

### What are data portals for?

Data portals are designed to put together datasets from across many sources in one place, presenting information about them consistently, and including features that assist end users in *discovering* the datasets they need. They also play an important role in connecting the data publisher and end user, for instance allowing people to more easily keep track of *updates and changes* to datasets they are using.

Most data portals combine datasets which are directly distributed on site, and remote datasets which are linked from the portal. Sometimes larger sized files and special requirements like geodata services are *hosted* externally, but in the the best case the user does not have to be aware of such details - and just use the data.

As data portals proliferate (there are several thousand portal projects worldwide), the question arises of what happens when datasets are published in multiple locations. *Federation* between portals is a kind of software contract that allows content to be shared between them.

### Portals for open data

An *open data portal* is one that has a focus on providing datasets which are licensed under open conditions. See [criteria for OGD](/identify/criteria) for more background. Open data portals provide access to data mainly from government offices ([opendata.swiss](/publish/opendata-swiss)), science and academia ([openresearchdata.ch](http://openresearchdata.ch)), maps and Geographic Information Systems ([geo.admin.ch](http://geo.admin.ch)), and so on. The [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/#for-government) has more background on how open data portals work and their benefits to the user community.

For more information and to learn how data is published on open data portals, see the [Publish topics](/category/publish/) in this Handbook.

### Links to Open Government Data portals

**[opendata.swiss](http://opendata.swiss)** is the official Open Government Data portal of the Swiss Confederation.

Several Swiss Cantons and Communes have already started federating their collections with **opendata.swiss**, some also run their own data portals:

- [Canton of Zürich](http://opendata.zh.ch/) (opendata.zh.ch)
- [City of Zürich](http://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) (data.stadt-zuerich.ch)
- [Canton of Geneva](http://ge.ch/sitg/donnees) (ge.ch)

**Worldwide - directories**

- [Dataportals.org](http://dataportals.org/) is a comprehensive directory of data portals.
- [OpenDataSoft](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/) maintains a list of open data portals and sites around the world.
- [Datahub.io](http://datahub.io) is a crowdsourced data portal run by Open Knowledge.
