A data inventory gives you an overview of the available data and makes it easier to identify those that are suitable for OGD. However, there is no reason not to publish individual datasets on opendata.swiss.

#### Situation at the federal level

The OGD Strategy for Switzerland 2014-2018 gives the Confederation the following task:

> **M4 Setting up an inventory of the Confederationâ€™s datasets**

> A central directory of Federal Administration datasets which are appropriate for OGD should gradually be drawn up and published. This inventory is a basis for further development and planning of the OGD offering.

The Federal Archives coordinate this central directory, which is to contain information about:

- data fonds in the form of databases
- registers (data warehouses)
- similar collections of structured datasets.  

The Federal Archives have already conducted a first round of inventorization and [documented it here](/en/library/bericht-datenbestaende-bund). The second round is scheduled for autumn 2016.

A number of countries have already accumulated more experience with data inventorization:

- [UK](http://data.gov.uk/data/search)
- [USA](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/implementation-guide)
- [Netherlands](http://www.openstate.eu/en/2014/10/government-wide-data-inventory-ready-in-spring-2015/)
