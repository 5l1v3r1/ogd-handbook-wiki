It is easy to start keeping track of datasets in a table or spreadsheet, but in a larger organization multiple people and departments collaborate on this task. One of the most important processes behind the creation of the data portals, essential to data services in a large organization, is to create a *data inventory*.

### Guidelines for Swiss publishers of OGD

In the report [Databases of the Confederation](/library/m4-datebestaende-bund), additional details are available which are particularly relevant to public institutions in Switzerland:

> The focus [of a data inventory] is on databases, registers and similar forms of official databases, which are managed by federal agencies under its legal mandate. This regardless of whether they are publicly available today or not. These databases provide potentially a huge benefit to the public.

The report also mentions what does _not_ need to be inventarised:

> - Documents, business files or classification systems - i.e. only structured data collections;
- All kinds of personal data collections of individual employees of the administration, which have been created ad hoc for their needs.
