## Further references

As soon as one starts [making an inventory](/identify/inventory) of datasets within an organization, a picture starts to emerge of technology, legal status, and process. It can be useful to apply rules to such a list and map out top candidates for OGD publication.

The report on [Boundaries between OGD and custom individual services](/library/m5-abgrenzung-leistungen) defines in more detail the concept of OGD, explains economic fundamentals of the production and use of open data in government, and provides a decision tree for use in evaluating publication criteria.

In the [Worksheet for government authorities](/library/m7-recht-arbeitshilfe), you will find a full description of the criteria on which the checklist above is based, including:

1. Is there a legal basis for the publication of the data set?
1. Can people be identified from attributes in the data, or do any records contain personal information?
1. Are these sensitive personal data?
1. Is there a legal precedent for the publication of such personal data?
1. Does a formal enactment exist for the publication of sensitive personal data?
1. Is any of the data to be published under copyright?
1. Were the copyrights of third parties or employees of the Federal Administration assigned to the federal government, with privacy rights waived?
1. May the records be published and made available for free?
1. May the records be used both non-commercially and commercially?
