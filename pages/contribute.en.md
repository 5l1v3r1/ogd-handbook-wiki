Here you will find an overview of ways to contribute to the OGD Handbook. Notably here we will explain the editorial workflow that we have put in place to keep a high overall standard of quality. We warmly welcome comments, corrections and additions, as well as suggestions for additional topics to explore.

<i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size: 300%; float: right;"></i>

Please check the public issue tracker first if you find a bug or have an improvement request: **[OGD Handbook Issues](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-wiki/issues)**

Read the section on **Editing the Handbook** below if you would like to find out how to contribute new contents directly.

Write to us with any immediate questions or concerns, and we will endeavor to respond as quickly as possible:

## Editing the Handbook

The source of the OGD Handbook is in a central [Git repository](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-wiki) that you can also access with a Web browser. We use the issue tracker there to collect bug reports, requests and ideas from our users.

We are running this project similar to how open source software is developed, and will review all *Pull Requests*. Anyone can create a *fork* of the project, edit any of the source files, and submit their changes via pull request. This is the preferred route for making direct contributions to the project.

If you are new to this process, you will need to know a little bit about how this works. There are three components you need some understanding of:

1. **Markdown**: is a simple markup language used to create rich documents ideal for web and print. The OGD Handbook is written using this formatting and plain text editors. By learning a few intuitive rules youâ€™ll be able to ensure content is formatted with headings, links, quotes, etc. For more information, please consult a [Markdown reference](http://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/).
2. **GitHub**: an online hosting service, which amongst other things offers version control and code management via a web interface. We use this to keep track of changes and moderate from this [central location](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-wiki).
3. **Pelican**: is open source software we use for generating a web site complete with all the layout, templates and features. This happens behind the scenes, but if you want to generate your own site like this one, you will need to install *Python* and follow the instructions in our [README](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-site/blob/master/README.md).

#### Getting started

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in. Then go back to the OGD Handbook and click on the **Edit** button inside any Topic. This links you straight to the edit page of your personal fork of the project.

Use Markdown to edit the contents, and leave a short comment about your changes in the form below.

Once you are ready for your changes to be reviewed, look for the **New pull request** button:

Inside the Pull Request comments, please give us a little bit of background on the intent of your changes.

You will be notified via GitHub once they have been moderated and accepted for inclusion in the next release of the OGD Handbook.
