The ‹Open Government Data› project organisation have worked out a joint solution for metadata. The portal opendata.swiss implements these standards - see [Publish on opendata.swiss](/en/publish/opendata-swiss).

The following documents on the selection and definition of OGD standards for metadata are available in the Library:

- [CH DCAT AP Reference](/de/library/ch-dcat-ap)
- [DCAT Application Profile](/en/library/dcat-application)
- [DCAT: Catalog](/en/library/dcat-catalog)
- [DCAT: Dataset](/en/library/dcat-dataset)
- [DCAT: Distribution](/en/library/dcat-distribution)
