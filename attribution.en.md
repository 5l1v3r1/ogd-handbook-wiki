Summary: Many datasets derive from others, and legal requirements sometimes explicitly demand attributing the source of the data. Here we explore implications for data publishers.

Attribution is a requirement of many licences, both the publishers and users should be sure they are correctly attributing the upstream sources of data. Citing sources should be a community norm, not just a provision in a license - similar to the best practice of scientific papers, where each has a list of references.

> "Acknowledging sources not only helps credit the work of data publishers, it also helps to identify widely-used, high-quality datasets."

Upstream data sources could be listed in various metadata provided, such as directly within the field descriptions, and in the description attached to the data - such as the one provided on an open data portal.

#### Guidance for Swiss data publishers

Visit the following articles in our library for further information on correct attribution and fair use requirements:

> If there is a legal obligation to the source, this is stated as of use in each record. In all other cases, an indication of the source is recommended with regard to the traceability of changes.

> [Rechtliche Grundlagen OGD](/de/library/m1-entscheid-rechtsgrundlagen)

> **1.8 Can the data be used, unless otherwise specified?**
If a legal basis providing a reference for the further use of the corresponding record prescribes that authorities must demand this. For all other records, the authorities may not require the source is acknowledged. On the portal is recommended but the users default for each data set, specify the source.
