## Data inventories

A *data inventory* is a listing of internal datasets created, maintained or even just stored within an organization or organizational unit. At its most basic, it is a list of data sources. A sophisticated inventory contains additional information about each dataset, such as:

- what format the data is in
- whether it is linked to databases
- does it contain private or sensitive information
- where it is stored
- what are conditions of use
- at what URL it has been published

It is easy to start keeping track of datasets in a table or spreadsheet, but less effective in a larger organization where multiple people collaborate on this task. Open Data Portals could be considered a type of data inventory, and the software systems behind them could be used to maintain a data inventory as well as to publish data.
