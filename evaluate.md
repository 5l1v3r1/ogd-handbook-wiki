## Metrics use

Active **use of metrics** can be used to judge the relative interest in different datasets, or evaluate approaches taken in disseminating the content. Metrics data (web, server, repos, social) should back any major strategic decisions in the evolution of the data.

Open source software that can be used to collect and re-publish metrics include [Piwik](http://www.piwik.org/), [graylog2](http://www.graylog2.org/), and [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/en/). Metrics data can also be embedded in the form of widgets into websites, and the metrics data in itself could be opened for public reuse.
