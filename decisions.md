Data protection is often referred to as *anonymising data* or preserving privacy. For instance, statistical surveys commonly take into the account the name, address and birth date of the person surveyed. As a minimum, personal names should be taken out, and addresses reduced to a more basic quantifier (e.g. locality, neighbourhood or postcode). In other cases it is less clear what parts of the dataset can lead to privacy concerns.

## International views on data protection

The Sunlight Foundation in the USA has made useful remarks in the [Open Data Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#sensitive-information) pertaining to the use of sensitive data:

> Any exemptions to data release should be crafted in a way that does not cut out access to information for researchers. Information that might be too sensitive for release to the public online can often be used by academic or nonprofit researchers who have agreed to protect sensitive information and not release it, except in aggregate form or in other ways that limit the potential for harm. This kind of release, with the research and insights it empowers, would benefit the interests of accountability, justice and oversight. Balance testing should still be used to ensure privileged information-sharing is not given priority over full public release when the public interest outweighs the potential for harm.
