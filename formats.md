There are many *data formats* in use, as data can take on many different formats and historically many different methods and software has been used for handling them. A relatively small number of "open" formats is accessible on all platforms, without the restrictions of proprietary standards.

## Recommendations

[SIARD eCH-0165](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en) specifies recommendations for Archiving of Databases developed by the Swiss association eCH, and will be summarised here. Discuss also the role CSV and UTF-8 has played in helping to open columnar data, and the Tabular Data Package specification.

- Data vs. metadata
- Proprietary vs. open
- Encoding vs. format
- Structured vs. unstructured
- Columnar vs. document-based
- Geographic data formats

## Migration tools

Here we discuss how data formats and exchange standards facilitate migrating metadata and actual data from one environment to another, potentially reducing longer term costs of maintenance and reuse. We will visualize the approach taken by standards like the [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) (OAI-PMH) and those of [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards) with newer initiatives like [Data Pipies](http://datapipes.okfnlabs.org/) and [Bubbles](http://bubbles.databrewery.org/), and what are some of the technical and logistical imperatives for such standards to be implemented efficiently.
