Summary: An exploration of common users of Open Government Data (OGD), and how they are best supported with reference to the Swiss OGD strategy.
Lang: en
Draft: yes


One key is continuously accounting for the diverse interests and needs of the user base, here you will learn about useful approaches and metrics.

## Understanding the audience

What we understand by data in the context of OGD is often the kind of specialised and detailed information that preoccupies teams of experts in statistics departments, university and corporate research labs. While expert users continue to be the focus and often the motivators of data collection, today's "data users" represent only a small part of the global interest potential. Here we try to address common beliefs and formulate an approach to capturing the wider perspective.

Topics we would suggest to explore here:

**Most common applications**

- policy monitoring
- citizen engagement
- cost/time saving
- innovative re-uses

**Where to find examples**

- Swiss landscape
- app showcases
- open data community
- around the world

**How to get started**

- finding ideas in data
- building prototypes
- hackathons and open source

### Data for government

Government data is generally created or mandated by government agencies, in the service of their own or another department. Sometimes the efforts undertaken to collect data are massive, take for example the large departments involved with environmental or economic data collection.

What happens once the original purpose of the data has been served? If another department wishes to take on the role of continuing to keep the information updated, would it be possible to transfer the competencies and methods? Can we afford to throw away and re-start efforts to create high quality data? By opening data within government, a major goal is to address these problems through models of sustainability similar to those being applied in society in response to economic and environmental crises. Data - plus all the information relevant to its use and maintainance - becomes an asset whose value is dramatically increased when proper standards are set to ensure its long-term applicability, and the conditions for its use are simplified.

To make good on this vision, more acceptance is needed on portability and transparency of processes throughout government organisations. It should be commonplace for one department to reuse the work of another without having to wait for weeks for permission or budget approval. Lightweight projects requiring a minimum of expenditure in IT will become possible when the necessary policy and technology standards become widespread.

In order to help understand the shifting barriers, please take part in the [OGD Landscape](landscape) survey if you are working in government - and tell us who you are sharing data with, with whom not, and what you see as challenges to OGD.

### Data for experts

For the overwhelming majority of users of data, applications and publications (websites, reports) are the gateway to data. The average user is a person who will rarely be interested in the raw data itself - rather than the way it can be used and visualized. The value of investing into improvements in data quality and availability seem difficult to justify only for the sake of an expert minority. So who are we opening data for? In order to find an answer to this question we need to understand how data is used.

Movements to popularise the various concepts of data (from open data to cloud computing) have focused their efforts to promoting the development of useful new apps - useful in terms of providing utility to the end-user. Often in the process they are showcasing the way open government data can be used, without expecting their audience to be involved in accessing or publishing data themselves. The implications of a wide variety of high quality open data become even more clear when high demand for new apps around the country and worldwide is considered. Users such as non-technical experts or businesses will often have other means - paid, and so on - to get access to raw data. Open data can enable anyone to build things with information that would otherwise lie locked up, dormant, and of little use.

In building up a community of interest, apps will represent the accomplishments of developers, and their collaboration with experts, data owners, designers, and so on. They highlight the availability of new data sets, help explore the opportunities and gaps, and reflect by their impact the public interest. Apps will also often be more quickly and cheaply developed if the data sets are highly accessible, and developers spend less time on cleaning up and converting the data, building upon the work of others.

The value of opening up government data stores to the public will be most clearly illustrated through the apps that will be built with them. In order to succeed with publishing data we need to think of possible non-primary uses for the data and in some cases even make improvements to the data in such a way that apps can be built from them.

### A remixing of roles

To use data effectively many roles are involved. It could be the same person, or an entire organisation. Here are some of the 'needs' of data:

- While being created, its consistency, completeness and accuracy needs to be ensured.
- When collected and recorded, appropriate meta-data needs to explain and identify it.
- As it is published or even just stored for later use, appropriate standards must be applied.
- Statistics help to validate against errors, and understand how the data can be used.
- Designing and creating charts and visualisations help to paint the bigger picture.
- Using programming or analysis, decisions can be facilitated according to some logic.

More often than not, successful applications of government data are a collaboration of individuals who may never meet, but whose work ties into each of the others. Lots of effort can go into every single set of data to increase the chance of succeeding down the line.
