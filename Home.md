The Swiss Open Government Data (OGD) Handbook is being developed to support individuals with responsibilities for data publishing at their government department, as well as the wider user base of the Swiss OGD portal. For these reasons we plan to integrate it within the portal as a centrally accessible, evolving knowledge base.

**[Open Government Data defined](definition)** covers the way OGD is understood in the context of this project, as well as exploring some complementary or contrary views from around the world.

**[The OGD landscape in Switzerland](landscape)** aims to paint a bird's eye view of the most prominent actors in the production, distribution and support of OGD.

**[Guide to the Swiss OGD Portal](ch-ogd)** discusses the (currently in pilot) federal portal, and what the requisite steps are in publishing your data there.

**[Index of Swiss OGD sites](ch-portals)** lists additional national portals, as well as those of several Cantons and Communes.
